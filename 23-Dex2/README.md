# Dex2

This level requires you to exploit the DexTwo contract, a subtly modified version of the previous Dex contract, in a different manner. Your goal is to drain all balances of token1 and token2 from the DexTwo contract to complete the level.

You begin with 10 tokens each of token1 and token2 and DexTwo contract initially holds 100 tokens each of token1 and token2.
