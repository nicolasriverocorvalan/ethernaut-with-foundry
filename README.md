# Ethernaut using Foundry

Using Foundry to educate on engineering processes during smart contract deployment while resolving [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com) challenges.

## Template for exercises

> ### Vulnerability
> Description of the vulnerability in the smart contract.
>
> ### Attack
> Steps to exploit the vulnerability.
>
> ### Fix
> How to fix the vulnerability to secure the smart contract. We will cover good coding practices, but that won't guarantee
> secure code. A lot of these contracts will need a complete refactor to be consider secure.
